# AI Code Reviewer

AI Code Reviewer is a GitHub Action that leverages multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to provide intelligent feedback and suggestions on your pull requests. This powerful tool helps improve code quality and saves developers time by automating the code review process.

## Features

- Supports multiple AI providers:
  - OpenAI (ChatGPT)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - Google (Gemini)
- Provides intelligent comments and suggestions for improving your code
- Reviews only new changes in PR updates
- Filters out files that match specified exclude patterns
- Easy to set up and integrate into your GitHub workflow

## Setup

1. Choose your preferred AI provider and get an API key:
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/account/keys)
   - [Google AI](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. Add the API key as a GitHub Secret in your repository:
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI
   - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude
   - `GOOGLE_AI_KEY` for Google Gemini

3. Create `.github/workflows/code-review.yml`:

```yaml

  pull_request:
